Goodwin State Forest to look for beech leaf disease, as part of my duties as a seasonal research assistant. It lies on the border between Chaplin and Hampton in Windham county, situated beneath Natchaug State Forest. The night before I’d been putting the final touches on a resume and cover letter I’d planned to submit for a job opening, only to realize that the job had stopped accepting applications. Lingering frustrations stuck with me as I drove to James L. Goodwin Sate Forest, but I was fortunate for the field day. I knew spending a day in the lab wasn’t going to provide me with the necessary mental distraction I craved. I needed to get away from my thoughts and insecurities, at least for a little while. There was little to no chance for rain, the weather was supposed to be cooler than it had been for the past couple of days, and I felt confident that this state forest would be a good site for beech.</p>\n<p>I parked in the central lot on Potter Road, situated at the southern end of Pine Acres Pond and across the street from the Goodwin Forest Conservation Center and Museum. Leaving the lot, I passed a picnic pavilion on my way to the Blue/Yellow Trail. From there, I had planned to follow the Blue/White  Trail northward along the pond. When I’d arrived at the start of the Blue/White Trail however, I came across a large sign informing me that the rest of the trail was closed. Okay, not a problem. I hadn’t walked far, and I still had other trail options; there was a Yellow Trail that branched off from the Blue/Yellow Trail and ran parallel to the Blue/White Trail. So I backtracked and followed the Yellow Trail up to the Yellow/Red Trail.</p>\n<p>While on the Yellow/Red Trail I passed a short, unblazed trail that connected to the Blue/White Trail. This made me question whether the entirety of the Blue/White Trail was off-limits, or just the first section of it I’d already passed. Either way, I ignored this shortcut and continued on my way, still satisfied with my new route. The sky was cloudy overhead, deflecting the sun’s harsh rays. There was a constant breeze guiding me down the path. I was focused on the hike ahead of me. I had left my stresses behind, leaving my mind free to wander as I looked for beech.</p>\n<p>I was approaching a four-way crossroads at the end of the Yellow/Red Trail, which branched off into the Red, Yellow, and Red/White Trails. From there, I’d planned to follow the Red Trail and continue northward up and around the pond. Except the bulletin posted at this crossroads informed me that the majority of the Red Trail was closed, in addition to parts of the Yellow Trail and the entirety of the Red/White Trail. According to the notice on the bulletin, these trails were deemed unsafe to hikers due to drought and gypsy moth damage.</p>\n<p>Why wasn’t this information posted at the large bulletin near the parking lot? Who knows.</p>\n<p>I stared at the laminated notice for several seconds, growing annoyed. I glanced back and forth between the Red and Yellow Trails branching off in opposite directions (no Robert Frost quotes here. No). The Red Trail would take me up to the other end of Pine Acres Pond. The Yellow Trail would lead me toward the marsh. I contemplated ignoring the sign and continuing on my path. But rather than risk getting myself into a dangerous situation I could have otherwise avoided, I eventually decided to turn around and proceed back down the Yellow/Red Trail and follow the unmarked shortcut onto the Blue/White Trail. Whatever. I hadn’t wasted that much time. It was still early. It was fine.</p>\n<p>I had a little less than a mile to go before I reached the junction where the Blue/White Trail crossed with the end of the Red Trail. Although at the rate I was traveling it felt more like two miles. The path was narrow, with vegetation creeping along the edges of the trail. The breeze was gone, sweat pooling under my arms and down my back as the humidity climbed. I constantly shooed away insects buzzing in my ears. I had to clamber up and over the leafy canopy of a fallen tree, no doubt a casualty from the storm the week before. I’d yet to see any beech. I quickly began second-guessing my chosen path, wondering if it was too late to explore the parts of the Yellow Trail that weren’t off limits. <em>Would I have had more luck there? Would I have time to circle back afterward?</em></p>\n<p>Questioning my judgement quickly caused my previous frustrations about the job posting to resurface. I was kicking myself for not turning the application in sooner. I started thinking about the three months I had left before my current seasonal job came to an end, dreading the structureless, angst-ridden days of unemployment I’d be returning to if I didn’t find another job.</p>\n<p>It was with much relief when I stumbled across my first grouping of beech about halfway up the trail. It was a small victory, but I took it. There were still no signs of beech leaf disease, but a least I now felt more confident moving forward and remaining committed to my path.</p>\n<p>When I got to the point where the Red Trail overlapped with the Blue/White Trail, I diverted momentarily from the Blue/White Trail to follow the Red Trail to Governor’s Island. This island (technically more of a peninsula than an island) sit in Pine Acres Pond. The short path ends at a viewing platform on the island. From the platform I heard the croaking of frogs and the buzzing of insects. A skipping water bug sent ripples across the water’s surface. Dragonflies hopped around on the platform railing. A hawk screeched overhead. I didn’t linger for very long on the platform. I wasn’t in the mindset to try and sit calmly staring at the water. I turned around and headed back to the Blue/White Trail, checking the canopies of a few beech I passed along the way.</p>\n<p>The ground was getting rockier and more uneven as I progressed along the Blue/White Trail. I was beginning to get sick and tired of this trail. Flies still pestered me. I was using the hem of my shirt to wipe sweat from my face. I was still finding beech, but the tangle of shrubs and saplings along the trail made it difficult for me to reach the trees. I sighed and pushed on. I knew there was an end up ahead. Complaining about it wouldn’t make the trail any shorter.</p>\n<p>Eventually I broke from the woods and stepped out onto Estabrooks Road. In order to loop back towards my car, I’d planned to follow the Air Line State Park Trail down the western side of the pond. The Blue/White Trail continued on the other side of the road, and I had the option of following it for another 0.17 miles toward the Air Line Trail, or walk along the road until it crossed the Air Line Trail. I took about twenty steps down the Blue/White Trail, before deciding to turn around and follow the road toward the Air Line Trail instead, figuring it would be quicker.</p>\n<p>I had only been walking down the road for a few minutes when I heard movement behind me. I hear noises in the woods all the time, and nine times out of ten it’s a squirrel or a chipmunk. I turned around and glanced up the road, fully expecting to see a squirrel ducking into the underbrush. Instead I glimpsed a person, dressed in black, running into the woods down the Blue/White Trail i.e. the trail I had decided at the last minute not to follow. They carried something long and skinny, gripping it in both hands as they ran.</p>\n<p>I was, admittedly, a little weirded out by this. Mostly because I had no idea where this person came from. There was nobody on the road with me. I hadn’t seen anyone walking on the trail behind me. Having my hiking stick with me put me slightly at ease, but not enough to stop me from doing a one-eighty and booking it down the remainder of the road to the Air Line Trail, glancing over my shoulder repeatedly as I went.</p>\n<p>The Air Line Trail was much wider than the previous trail I’d been on. There were also fewer beech. This didn’t bother me, since it enabled me to focus on finishing the hike. I stayed on this trail for more than a mile, being passed by a biker and a jogger as I went. I then left this trail to follow the Blue Trail along the pond and back to the parking lot. I never found signs of beech leaf disease.</p>\n<p>I had higher expectations for this field day. Mostly I wanted something to distract me from my failure to submit the job application before the closing date. Someone once told me that time spent thinking about a decision that’s already been made is wasted mental energy. And much like how it’s a waste of brain space to worry about past decisions, it’s also a waste to worry or feel bad about things that are beyond one’s control. Beating myself up over what I could or should have done differently makes it harder to move forward. If the trail is closed, you pick another one. Don’t think too hard about it. If the job is no longer accepting applicants, you find another one.</p>\n<p>I still have a long way to go when it comes to being less critical of myself and acknowledging my accomplishments, something I hope to improve on in 2021. I know the trail eventually ends, even if I can’t see it. I know I’ll eventually find a permanent job, even if I don’t know when that’ll be. The only way to get there is to push on through the weeds and bumps along the way.</p>\n<p>Also, if you’re venturing into the woods alone, bring a stick with you.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
