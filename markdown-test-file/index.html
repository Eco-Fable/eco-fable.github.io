The pandemic certainly did not alleviate these feelings, and no doubt probably made them much worse. During 2020 it was difficult to find the motivation to do things that would make me happy in the long run, like writing or honing another skill that I could be proud of as I struggled to find a permanent job. Instead I’d seek out YouTube, a TV show, or webcomic to distract myself from these thoughts. But these activities only served to deepen my feelings of laziness and lack of productivity. Logically I can tell myself that 2020 hasn’t exactly been stingy in the amount of physical and mental stressors it’s thrown our way. Yet I still blame myself for my emotions; for being inadequate to deal with the stress and for not using my time to push my productivity to its fullest extent. Accompanying this unhappiness, however, is also guilt. As a person who is born with certain privileges, do I have the right to feel unhappy when there are those less fortunate than myself?</p>
<p>During times like this, it’s hard to imagine that things will get better. 2020 may be over and done, but we still don’t know what 2021 may have in store for us (for me, 2021’s motto will continue to be “No promises” until I am proven otherwise). I joke how pessimism is my default setting, but that’s not entirely accurate. I don’t assume each day is going to be a bad one. I look forward to planned events (pre-COVID), and enjoy spending time with those I love. Perhaps “cautionary” is the better word. Sometimes it’s just easier to assume the worst, as a built-in defense for ourselves when the worst hits us. This is one of those times when I was preparing myself for the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2020, I was working as a seasonal research assistant. On this particular day in June, I was looking for beech leaf disease along the Double Loop Trail on Warpas Road in Madison, Connecticut. There was no formal parking lot, just a bare strip of dirt and mud along the edge of the road at the trailhead. There was one car parked there already when I arrived, around 2:00 in the afternoon.
I glanced out my window to survey the muddy patch carved with tire tracks, beyond which was a drier patch that I planned to park my car. It’s not that deep, I thought. I then backed up, pulled off the road, drove my car into the mud, and that is where it stayed. I pressed down on the gas, meeting more resistance than I expected. I could hear my tires spinning. I tried again, but my car remained stuck. I then turned off the engine and slid out of the car. My two front tires had sunk deep into the mud.
I grabbed my phone from the car and dialed my boss’s number. No answer. I then tried his cell. Still no answer. I left a voicemail for each number. I then leaned up against the driver’s side door, picking at a hangnail as I waited for my boss to call me back.</p>
<p>The panic hadn’t set in just yet. This was refreshing, considering (as I’ve already established) I’m generally a glass-half-empty kind of person. Mostly what I felt at the moment was embarrassment. It was only my third day of field work, and I was already causing problems. I was positive none of the other seasonals had experienced this before. They probably knew better than to try and cruise through mud with only front-wheel drive. I had already been hiking around the Westwoods Trail in Guilford that morning. I was tired. My hair, roped into a messy ponytail, resembled a frizzy tumbleweed. My arms were sticky with bug spray, and my T-shirt was clinging to my back sweat.
How long was I going to be stuck like this? Oh God, would they need to send a tow truck? Should I head out on the trail and worry about this when I got back?
I folded my arms and avoided looking at my caked tires. I glanced up at a tree about six feet from the car. From one of its outstretched branches I saw a cluster of leaves bearing distinct, dark green stripes along the bands. Beech leaf disease. Well, at least I didn’t have to look hard to find it.
I tried dialing the office again, when I heard a car slow on the road behind me. An older man rolled down his window and asked if I was stuck. There was an older woman in the passenger seat beside him. I sheepishly said yes, and watched as he pulled their car over to park on a dry patch on the opposite side of the other car that I’d failed to notice before driving into the mud.
The couple came over to survey the situation. The man then instructed me to put my car in reverse while he pushed from the front. I did as I was told. When my car didn’t budge, he tried pushing from the back while I put my car in drive. My car stayed stuck. Just then a truck pulled over and two guys climbed out. They called out to the older man, who seemed to know them. Before I knew it, I had a team of strangers attempting to free my car from the mud. Since I’ve already established how ill-prepared I was for the situation, I just did what they told me to do; putting the car in drive, then shifting to reverse as they used their combined strength to try and free my car. When the car still refused to budge, I got out and watched, a little bewildered and unsure what to do with myself, while the older man and one of the other guys retrieved a pair of shovels from the truck bed and proceeded to dig out my sunken tires. The third got in the truck and drove down the street to retrieve a chain.
The truck returned a few minutes later, and the chain was attached to the back of my car. They then instructed me to put the car in neutral. I did as I was told, sitting behind the wheel as the truck dragged my car back and out of the mud. Relieved, I climbed back out, thanking them immensely. The older man responded, “Well, you looked like a damsel in distress. We knew we had to stop to lend you a hand.”
Normally my hackles would raise at anyone using me and the word “damsel” in the same sentence. But in that moment, I didn’t care. It was still early. The trail wasn’t that long. I could still survey some trees and collect enough symptomatic leaves before heading back to New Haven. I waved goodbye as the two men gathered up their supplies and drove off. I then said my goodbyes to the nice couple, and moved my car onto the dry spot their car had previously occupied. Far away from the mud. I then called my boss to fill him in, grabbed my gear, and set out on the trail.
I should mention that none of us were wearing masks during this whole encounter (I carry a mask with me, but I don’t usually wear it when I’m working in the field alone). To be honest, at the time, I wasn’t thinking about COVID-19. I was thinking about doing my job, worried about how long I was going to be stranded along an unfamiliar road, and taken aback at how swiftly these people chose to come to my aid.
I’m not going to try and make any heartfelt statements about humanity or kindness. Anything I could write would come out sounding way too hokey. But thinking back on this encounter, I’m still surprised at how shocked I was when that first car stopped and the couple asked if I was alright. I was slowly bracing myself to be stuck there for the next several hours. And yet I was fortunate enough to run into people who, despite the pandemic and the need for social distancing, were willing to lend a hand to someone in need.
Preparing for the worst has its advantages, but it can also sometimes mean that I’m unprepared for when good things happen. And they do happen. It’s just nice to be reminded once in a while.</p>
